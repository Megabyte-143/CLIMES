# CLIMES
We propose a social media platform for individuals and organizations to communicate with each other regarding the environment.

Environmental issues, climate change, etc. are understood by some but lack of knowledge and reach suppress their spirit to make a change.
On our platform NGOs, environmental organizations, groups or movements can communicate with each other. It will help local groups to have more reach so that they can contribute constantly.
Individuals may also socialize their contributions to the environment.

In INDIA many don't have the CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION which is needed to make them realize the changes which will affect their lives unknowingly.  Our platform will make them understand the CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION both directly and indirectly.
Directly- As they open the website they may go to the tabs and will find all the possible ways by which they are contributing to climate change and the solutions to it. Along with this, there will always be some facts that pop up whenever they surf on the website, it will provide them the knowledge which they may use to get started or to add them in their ongoing activities. 

Indirectly- The second service which we provide will be the game called FPRINTS, in it, the user will input the daily activities he/she did and will get a score based on the carbon footprints and the alternatives or solutions to it which they may adapt to score higher, this how they will indirectly understand the climate change education.

Now we talk about the prototype

It would start something like this, first, the user will have to login or register on the website which is developed on HTML and CSS, and if he/she will have to register on the website it will show something like this.
On the signup page user have to input the basic personal details then he will be directed to the next page showing to mark his/her interest in the field of environmentalist, after which they will be directed to the next slide which contains some photo questions about their diet, clothing, medicines, their use of public transport and many more, which they will answer and it will show them their general FRINTS SCORE. It will make them familiar with the game, FRINTS.

After logging in 
The user can also create their own characters regarding their personality to make them feel more entertaining while using this website.
In the center there is a feed section where various organisations and NGO's realted to environment share posts and valuable information which makes the user know about the environment.
We also provide a learning tab where the user can get all knowledge about the climate and how the user can contribute in making a change in the environment.
Since the topic of imporoving the environment is not able to attract much population, we created a solution to this.
We decided to introduce a small game or daily task type thing in which user will enter about 
What they eat veg or non-veg, 
What they used for moving for eg. public transport or personal vehicle, 
What they used more plastic bags or paper bags,
Using these details we will count their carbon-footprints and according to that they will be rewarded points.

In future we will go for app development.
